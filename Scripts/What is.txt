This folder is for the python and SQL that I wrote to create this website. 
While this site is a static site, to create the maps I utlized Python, 
and for the Querys in ArcGisPro I utilized ArcGisPro's dialect of SQL
and I wanted to showcase the python work I had to do. Most of the work 
was done in the the PyCharm IDE and then moved into VSCode.
